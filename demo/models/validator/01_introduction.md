# Validator

The Validator class models the strict, or _canonical_, specification of the `.index`
file. It is used internally to validate the a `.index` file as it is loaded into
the Specification class.

NOTE: This set of tests includes the `Indexer::V0` module into the testing
namespace to simplify testing to revision 0 of Indexer.
