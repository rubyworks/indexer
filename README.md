# Ruby Metaspec

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dotruby/dotruby.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rubyworks/metaspec)

Metaspec is a well-defined project/package metadata specification for Ruby projects.

A projects metadata is stored in a `.meta` file. The specification is very strict,
yet simple enough for Ruby developers to work with the file format directly.

The Metaspec project also provides a conveneient API for working with a .meta file
and its data.
