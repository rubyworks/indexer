# Rumbler

## Ruby Metadata Enabler

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rubyworks/rumbler.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rubyworks/rumbler)

Rumbler provides a detailed and well-defined project metadata specification
for Ruby projects.

A projects metadata is stored in a `.ruby` file. The specification is very strict,
yet simple enough for Ruby developers to work with the file format directly.

The project also provides a conveneient API for working with `.ruby` files
and its data.
