# Rumbler

## Enable Your Ruby Projects Metadata

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rubyworks/rumbler.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rubyworks/rumbler)

Rumbler defines a detailed and well-defined project metadata specification
for Ruby projects.

A project's metadataq is canonized and stored in a `.ruby.lock` file.
The specification is very strict, yet simple enough for Ruby developers
to work with the file format without an intermediate API.

Howerver, the project also provides a conveneient API for working with
specification and its data when suitable to the usecase.
